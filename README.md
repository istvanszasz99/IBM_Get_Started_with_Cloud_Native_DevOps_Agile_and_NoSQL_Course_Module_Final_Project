# IBM Get Started with Cloud Native, DevOps, Agile, and NoSQL Course Module | Final Project

## Instructions:

- Task 1: Run unit tests using Jasmine. The screen capture should display output showing seven passed specs and 0 failures. Save the screen capture as 01-jasmine-tests-passing.
- Task 2: Create a Dockerfile to deploy in a local Docker container. The Dockerfile should display the first line as FROM nginx, and five lines for the following individual file: (favicon.ico, index.html, script.js, style.css, and taxCalculator.js). Save the screen capture as container 02-dockerfile.
- Task 3: Build a Docker image. Take a screen capture of the terminal window displaying the docker build command running successfully and save it as 03-docker-build-output. 
- Task 4: Deploy and test the web application deployed in a Docker container. Take a screen capture of the browser hosting the Tax Calculator web running on port 8080. Save the screen capture as 04-docker-image-browser.
- Task 5: Tag and push to IBM Cloud Registry. Take a screen capture of the terminal output showing the push completed successfully. Save your screen capture as 05-docker-icr-push.
- Task 6: Deploy the Tax Calculator on IBM Cloud. Take a screen capture showing details of the tax calculator deployed on IBM Cloud and save the screen capture as 06-deployed-on-cloud.
- Task 7: Create the Tekton Pipeline npm and Jasmine task definitions. Take a screen capture of tasks.yaml that shows two new task definitions (npm and Jasmine) and save the screen capture as 07-tasks-yaml.
- Task 8: Extend the pipeline to call the required task. Take a screen capture of the pipeline.yaml file that shows the npminstall tests and build. Save the screen capture as 08-pipeline-changes.
- Task 9: Run a Tekton pipeline. Take a screen capture that shows that you input all required sections in the run.yaml file. Save the screen capture as 09-run-yaml. 
- Task 10: Deploy the image built using pipeline and save a screen capture of the deployed image as 10-final-output.
